        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <uL>
            <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>kosher salt, to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of your favorite BBQ sauce</li>
        </uL>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the grill for direct cooking at high heat (450°F). Brush the 
                cooking grates clean.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the chicken breasts with extra virgin olive oil and rub over 
                the breasts. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black 
                pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts on the hot grill. Cover and cook for 5-6 minutes 
                or until they easily release from the grates. Flip the chicken and cook for 
                4-5 minutes longer. Baste the chicken breasts with BBQ sauce, flip and cook 
                for 2 minutes on each side. Repeat on the other side. Cook until the 
                breasts are firm to the touch and opaque all the way through, registering 
                160°F internal temp (the temp will rise to 165°F as the chicken 
                rests).</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate and cover with a piece of aluminum foil and let rest 
                for 5 minutes. Serve with more BBQ sauce if desired.</li>
        </ol>
