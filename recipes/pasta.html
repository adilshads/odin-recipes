        <h3>Fresh Italian Pasta Taste Amazing</h3>

        <p>
            This homemade pasta recipe is our new favorite cooking project! Lately, Jack 
            and I have been spending even more time than usual in the kitchen, 
            experimenting with bread, baked goods, and even okonomiyaki. But we keep 
            coming back to homemade pasta. It’s super fun to make together, and it only r
            equires a handful of basic ingredients. Of course, the fact that it’s 
            absolutely delicious doesn’t hurt either.

            My homemade pasta recipe refers to the pasta maker attachment for the 
            KitchenAid Stand Mixer, which is how we roll out our fresh pasta at home. 
            If you don’t have a KitchenAid, don’t worry! You could also roll out this 
            pasta dough according to the instructions on a regular pasta maker. However 
            you make it, I hope you try this recipe. It’s an easy, fun way to spend an 
            hour in the kitchen with someone you love, and at the end, you get to eat a 
            big plate of chewy noodles with a perfect al dente bite.
