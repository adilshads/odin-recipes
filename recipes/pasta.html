        <p>
            This homemade pasta recipe is our new favorite cooking project! Lately, Jack 
            and I have been spending even more time than usual in the kitchen, 
            experimenting with bread, baked goods, and even okonomiyaki. But we keep 
            coming back to homemade pasta. It’s super fun to make together, and it only r
            equires a handful of basic ingredients. Of course, the fact that it’s 
            absolutely delicious doesn’t hurt either. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My homemade pasta recipe refers to the pasta maker attachment for the 
            KitchenAid Stand Mixer, which is how we roll out our fresh pasta at home. 
            If you don’t have a KitchenAid, don’t worry! You could also roll out this 
            pasta dough according to the instructions on a regular pasta maker. However 
            you make it, I hope you try this recipe. It’s an easy, fun way to spend an 
            hour in the kitchen with someone you love, and at the end, you get to eat a 
            big plate of chewy noodles with a perfect al dente bite.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul> 
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>First, make a nest with the flour on a clean work surface. Add 
                the remaining ingredients to the center and use a fork to gently break
                up the eggs. Try to keep the flour walls intact as best as you can! </li>
            <li>Next, use your hands to gently mix in the flour. Continue working the 
                dough to bring it together into a shaggy ball.</li>
            <li>Then, knead! At the beginning, the dough should feel pretty dry, but stick 
                with it! It might not feel like it’s going to come together, but after 
                8-10 minutes of kneading, it should become cohesive and smooth:If the dough 
                still seems too dry, sprinkle your fingers with water and continue kneading 
                to incorporate it into the dough. If the dough becomes too sticky, dust more 
                flour onto your work surface.</li>
            <li>When the dough comes together, shape it into a ball and wrap it in plastic 
                wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the dough rests, slice it into 4 pieces.</li>
            <li>Use a rolling pin or your hands to gently flatten one into an oval disk.</li>
            <li>Then, run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker (level 1 on 
                the KitchenAid attachment). I run the dough through the pasta maker 3 
                times on this setting before proceeding to the next step. If you don’t 
                have the KitchenAid attachment, roll out the dough according to your pasta 
                maker’s instructions.</li>
            <li>Next, fold the dough… if you want to. This step is somewhat optional, but 
                it will make your final pasta sheet more rectangular, which will yield 
                more long strands of pasta. Plus, it’s super simple! Just lay the dough 
                flat and fold both short ends in to meet in the center.</li>
            <li>Then, fold it in half lengthwise to form a rectangle.</li>
            <li>Once you’ve folded the dough, roll it out to your desired thickness. On my 
                KitchenAid attachment, I run it through the pasta roller three times on 
                level 2, three times on level 3, and one time each on levels 4, 5, and 6.</li>
            <li>Repeat these steps with the remaining dough pieces. Each time you finish 
                with a piece of dough, lay one half of it on a lightly floured baking 
                sheet. Sprinkle the dough with flour, and fold the other half on top. 
                Sprinkle the top with flour, too!</li>
            <li>Finally, cut and cook the pasta. Run the pasta sheets through your desired 
                pasta cutter attachment. Cook the noodles in a pot of boiling salted water 
                for 1 minute, and enjoy!</li>
