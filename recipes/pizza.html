        <h3>The Best Pizza is Homemade</h3>
        
        <p>
            The crust, sauce, and toppings of your homemade pizza are the bases of your 
            pizza In the following recipe we will go through how to best make your pizza!
        </p>

        <p>
            The crust should be crispy, and store bought dough can be used for your
            homemade pizza. You should make sure to give your pizza dough plenty of time 
            to rise. Pre-made marinara sauces are great for homemade pizza, or homemade 
            sauces in my opinion are even better! Finally be sure to use fresh vegitables 
            for your toppings.
