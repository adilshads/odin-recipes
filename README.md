Odin Recipes Project

Introduction 

The goal of the project is to practice all the HTML knowledge I have gained in the 
oding project by building a basic recipe website. This website will demonstrate the 
ability to build a main index page, with links to multiple recipes. Common elements 
will be used to build and design the website.
